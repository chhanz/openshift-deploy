        If defined, openshift_master_ca_certificate must include two

        only the single certificate that signs the OpenShift Container Platform
        certificates. If you have intermediate certificates in your chain, you

        It must contain only the single certificate that signs the OpenShift
        Container Platform certificates. If you have intermediate certificates
        in your chain, you must bundle them into ca-bundle.crt. It is possible
        the ca.crt and ca-bundle.crt files are symlinked, in which case you
        will need to seperate the two to achieve the desired configuration.
